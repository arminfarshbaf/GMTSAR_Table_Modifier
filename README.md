# GMTSAR_Table_Modifier
1) If you are having the same problem as me with "baseline_table.dat" files created by GMTSAR "baseline.m" can be helpful to edit the files to appropriate format.
2) In order to create the "scene.tab" and "intf.tab" required for sbas step in GMTSAR processing use "INTFandScene.m" which requires "baseline_table" and "intflist" as text inputs.
